# Langchain Java Server

> An experiment on executing prompts with Claude API using Java Spring Web

Albeit it is very fast to set up Langchain and expose its functionalities to the web via libraries like FastAPI or Django, Python is comparatively slow compared to compiled languages like Java.

The target of this experiment is to ensure the feasibility of using Langchain in Java.

It seems that Langchain4J does not have all the features I was hoping to implement for Claude like Function Calling based on OpenAPI Specification.

Even then, I would say this is a good experiment as I was able to experiment
1. Langchain4J
2. Java Spring

for the first time in my life.
